The purpose of this project is to create a page that runs client side, and helps Daily Texan readers in the November 4 elections. Using the Google Civics API, readers will see their local polling places and the candidates in contests that they are voting in. Using simple basic string manipulation, readers are also provided with a link to a search of the Daily Texan site for any given candidate's name.
